# Daily-Planner-wk-6


## Description

As a User I created a work day planner that will track what you do throughout the working day.  It will display the current time and date when the page is opened.  A User can select a date by clicking on the data input field.  When User has completed the input, the save button "when clicked" will save the data to localStorage of the browser.  The data in localStorage will display when browser is refreshed if there is any saved local data.  The data field will also change colors that will reflect past, present or future times of the current date and time.
