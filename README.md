## Description

As a User I created a work day planner that will track what you do throughout the working day.  It will display the current time and date when the page is opened.  A User can select a date by clicking on the date input field which will bring up a display of multiple months.  Below the date is a work day hourly schedule that a User can input information to. By clicking on the "add info button" a modal will appear with input fields that will save and print to the hours specified timeblock.  A User can simply click outside the modal window to close it and/or complete the input fields to populate the information to planner timeblocks.
